Various Deltarune mods I've made.
Use UndertaleModTool to run these scripts to install the mods.
The file name indicates what Chapter they're for. DRA means it can be used on all chapters.

Easy Ring

Replaces the Dice Brace with the Easy Ring, a strong armor that gets better with each chapter.
Increases i-frames and makes some overworld segments easier.

Weird Start

Naming yourself "SNOWGRAVE" will make the game start as if you did the weird route in Chapter 2.
Useful for if you lose your save or something.

Chapter 4 Restoration

Restores a removed rose animation and a censored Susie line for Chapter 4

Violent Spare

Defeating an enemy with violence spares them instead of them running away.

Rhythm Editor

Enables debug mode and makes it so that starting a new game in Chapter 3 loads up the rhythm game editor.
